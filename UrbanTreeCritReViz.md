# Critique by Design
## A redesign of Urban Forestry Data for Ann Arbor, MI

### Original Data Set & Background
For this assignment, I set out to reimagine three charts shared as part of an article found on the (now defunct) [Ann Arbor Chronicle](https://annarborchronicle.com/2010/05/28/environmental-indicators-trees/index.html), "Environmental Indicators: Trees", which explored "Urban forestry: species diversity, size class, and canopy". These charts where shared as part of a four-part series on “environmental indicators used by the city of Ann Arbor in its State of Our Environment Report” (Gray et al., 2010).

The original charts I chose to work on are displayed here:

I chose these three charts because while I understood what the authors were trying to convey with their inclusion, I felt adjustments to color, order, and layout could enhance how quickly the reader is able to understand their purpose and the urgency of the messages the charges were aiming for. Using the Effectiveness Profile (Few, 2017), I approached the three charts with following adjustments in mind: 

For “Tree Diversity by Genus”, the author is illustrating that the Acer (Maple) tree makes up too large a portion of the urban forest in Ann Arbor, MI.  However, by giving every other type of tree in the inventory its own color, attention is drawn instead to deciphering the “rainbow wheel” before evaluating the larger pieces of the pie, decreasing the perceptibility.  To illustrate the towering lead the Maple tree has over almost all other trees in the area, a bar chart lining them up from largest to smallest proportion of the forest may be more effective. 

For “Size Class Distribution of Total Tree Population”, the reverse of the first chart may be the case. For this section, the author wanted to make the point that a good indicator of the urban forest’s health was the diverse and mostly even mix of tree ages (as estimated by the tree’s diameter).  By showing it in a bar chart, the reader may believe they are to be comparing one tree size to another, instead of envisioning the total makeup of the forest.  For this one, I would suggest using a pie chart to emphasize that distribution and variety of tree ages/sizes. 

For “Existing Urban Tree Canopy (UTC)”, the unique style and 3D projection make this chart stand out too much from the other two, reducing the consistency of the data visualizations.  Additionally, by lining the cities up alphabetically, it’s hard to understand where Ann Arbor, MI ranks against cities of similar sizes.  To estimate if they are doing better or worse comparatively, one has to scan from left to right and back again often, while cross-checking the city labels on the x-axis. I would update this chart both asthetically and would order it from largest-to-smallest tree canopy, to display where Ann Arbor falls among its peers.
