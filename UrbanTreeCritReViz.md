# Critique by Design
## A redesign of Urban Forestry Data for Ann Arbor, MI

For this assignment, I set out to reimagine three charts shared as part of an article found on the (now defunct) [Ann Arbor Chronicle](https://annarborchronicle.com/2010/05/28/environmental-indicators-trees/index.html), "Environmental Indicators: Trees", which explored "Urban forestry: species diversity, size class, and canopy". These charts where shared as part of a four-part series on “environmental indicators used by the city of Ann Arbor in its State of Our Environment Report” (Gray et al., 2010).
