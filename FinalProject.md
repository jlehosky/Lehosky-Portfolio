# Breating Easier in the Pittsburgh Urban Forest

## Introduction
For my final project, I want to inspire readers to support the efforts of [Tree Pittsburgh](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/); “an environmental non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing community vitality by restoring and protecting the urban forest through tree planting and care, education, advocacy, and land conservation” (Tree Pittsburgh, 2020). While there is a myriad of benefits to increasing a city’s urban forest canopy, the most primary data I’ll be using is from historical and current measurements of the air quality of the Pittsburgh region.  

## Data Sources

## Inital Sketches & Storyboard

## User Research and Interviews
### What I Hope to Find:
Taking note from our recent in-class discussion on how to create the user story, my hope for readers (including these test users), will want to help contribute to an improved urban forest, so that they can enjoy better quality, among other benefits. 

### Target Audience:
I have selected the following Pittsburgh-based test users, with an aim to incude a diverse set of ages, professions, and educational backgrounds
