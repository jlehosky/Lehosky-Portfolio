# Breathing Easier in the Pittsburgh Urban Forest

## Introduction & Outline
For my final project, I want to inspire readers to support the efforts of the [Tree Pittsburgh](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/); “an environmental non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing community vitality by restoring and protecting the urban forest through tree planting and care, education, advocacy, and land conservation” (Tree Pittsburgh, 2020). While there is a myriad of benefits to increasing a city’s urban forest canopy, the primary data I’ll be using is from historical and current measurements of the air quality of the Pittsburgh region.  

As suggested in Chapter 8 of Good Charts (Berinato, 2016), I’ve divided my narrative into three sections as follows:

**Setup: The current reality**
* Opening with a dramatic visual to capture the reader’s attention and paint a dire picture (diametrically opposed images seperated by slider)
* Sharing a current view of pollution levels in the Pittsburgh area, as compared to the least/most polluted cities in the U.S. (1-3 bar charts)

**Conflict: Information to make the reader aware just how far Pittsburgh still has to go**
* Tile plots comparing Allegheny County Air Quality Index (AQI)scores over a 30 year span (by either 5 or 10 year increments) {
    "mockup": {
        "controls": {
            "control": [
                {
                    "ID": "5",
                    "typeID": "PointyButton",
                    "zOrder": "0",
                    "measuredW": "310",
                    "measuredH": "27",
                    "x": "357",
                    "y": "143",
                    "properties": {
                        "direction": "left",
                        "text": "Also shows improvement, but not good enough...",
                        "color": "16776960"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "attributes": {
            "name": "New Wireframe 1",
            "order": 1000000,
            "parentID": null
        },
        "resourceID": "2A14A39A-0619-4C86-A703-4AD2AA75E79A",
        "mockupH": "27",
        "mockupW": "310",
        "measuredW": "667",
        "measuredH": "170",
        "version": "1.0"
    },
    "groupOffset": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0
    },
    "dependencies": []
}
* Line graphs of air quality measurements over 20-year period; the catch is that while these charts reflect a great improvement, the present day levels STILL exceed acceptable levels, earning Allegheny County a continuing "F" grade across all three air pollution measures (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)
  
**Resolution: The new/potential reality**
* There’s hope! Here’s information on Pittsburgh success stories 
* How YOU can you help your community thrive and breath easier by partnering with Tree Pittsburgh

Putting myself into the shoes of those reading and viewing this information, I've used the "user stories" tool to hone in on what will motivate them to take interest in this issue, and leading calls to action available to the reader/user:

**As a reader I want to** help support Tree Pittsburgh’s goal of planting more trees 

**So that I can:**
* Enjoy better air quality in my community
* Improve community relations
*	Increase area property values

**I can do this by:**
*	Volunteering to plant and care for city trees
*	Contributing financially 
*	Learning more / educating myself
*	Organizing volunteer opportunities within my community

To the tell this story, I plan to use Storyboard, and will be suplementing this with charts from Flourish and Tableau, and images from Unplash and Pexels.

## Data Sources

**The American Lung Association’s 2020 [State of the Air](http://www.stateoftheair.org/) Report**

I will be using data from this report to illustrate both:

* How Pittsburgh ranks on various measures compared to the best/worst cities in the U.S.  
* A 20-year historical snapshot of the linear progress made in the Pittsburgh area as it relates to the three measures of air pollution (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)

I will be using daily AQI data from the EPA to visually display the improvement of the AQI in Allegheny County from the 1980’s until present day.

## Inital Sketches & Storyboard

## User Research and Interviews
### What I Hope to Find
Taking note from our recent in-class discussion on how to create the user story, my hope for readers (including these test users), is that they will will feel moved to learn more and/or contribute to improving the Pittsburgh urban forest, so that they can enjoy better air quality, among other benefits. I will hope to hear feedback from my test users that they felt, or did not feel, a combination of 1) shocked/alarmed by the historical and current data and 2) moved to learn more about how to help improve the situation. 

### Target Audience
I have selected the following Pittsburgh-based test users, with an aim to incude a diverse set of ages, professions, and educational backgrounds
* Female, 20's, Non-Profit Fundraising
* Female, 30's, Nurse
* Male, 40's, Sales
* Female, 60's, Retired 
* Male, 60's, Priest
