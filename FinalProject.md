# Breathing Easier in the Pittsburgh Urban Forest

## Introduction
For my final project, I want to inspire readers to support the efforts of the [Tree Pittsburgh](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/); *“an environmental non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing community vitality by restoring and protecting the urban forest through tree planting and care, education, advocacy, and land conservation”* (Tree Pittsburgh, 2020). While there is a myriad of benefits to increasing a city’s urban forest canopy, the primary data I’ll be using to compel readers/viewers to action is historical and current measurements of the air quality/pollution of the Pittsburgh region.  

### Outline & Story Arc
As suggested in Chapter 8 of Good Charts (Berinato, 2016), I’ve divided my narrative into three sections, and the desired emotional response to each section is coded as :red_circle:Urgent, :yellow_circle:Concerning, :green_circle:Optimistic for the future, and :bulb:Neutral Knowledge:

**Setup: The current reality**

:red_circle: Opening with a dramatic visual to capture the reader’s attention and paint a dire picture (diametrically opposed images separated by slider)

:yellow_circle: Sharing a current view of pollution levels in the Pittsburgh area, as compared to the least/most polluted cities in the U.S. (1-3 bar charts)

:bulb: How do urban trees improve air quality and community engagement?

**Conflict: Information to make the reader aware just how far Pittsburgh still has to go**

:yellow_circle: Tile plots comparing Allegheny County Air Quality Index (AQI) scores over a 40-year span (by either 10 or 20 year increments) 

:red_circle: Line graphs of air quality measurements over 20-year period; the catch is that while these charts reflect a great improvement, the present day levels STILL exceed acceptable levels, earning Allegheny County a continuing "F" grade across all three air pollution measures (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)
  
**Resolution: The new/potential reality**

:green_circle: There’s hope! Here’s information on Pittsburgh success stories 

:green_circle: How YOU can you help your community thrive and breathe easier by partnering with Tree Pittsburgh



### User Stories / Narrative
Putting myself into the shoes of those reading and viewing this information, I've used the "user stories" tool we practiced in class to hone in on what will motivate viewers to take interest in this issue, and the calls to action available to the reader/user:

**As a reader I want to** help support Tree Pittsburgh’s goal of planting more trees 

**So that I can:**
* Enjoy better air quality in my community
* Improve community relations
*	Increase area property values

**I can do this by:**
*	Volunteering to plant and care for city trees
*	Contributing financially 
*	Learning more / educating myself
*	Organizing volunteer opportunities within my community

To the tell this story, I plan to use Storyboard, and will be supplementing this with charts from Flourish and Tableau, and images from Unplash and Pexels.

## Data Sources

**The American Lung Association’s 2020 [State of the Air](http://www.stateoftheair.org/) Report**

I will be using data from this report to illustrate both:
1. How Pittsburgh ranks on various measures compared to the best/worst cities in the U.S.  
1. A 20-year historical snapshot of the linear progress made in the Pittsburgh area as it relates to the three measures of air pollution (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)

*Note: ALS created their rankings based on data retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency and cite their sources in the [Methodology and Acknowledgements]( http://www.stateoftheair.org/about/methodology-and-acknowledgements.html) section of the ALS State of the Air website.*


**United States Environmental Protection Agency – Outdoor Air Quality Data Website**

I will be using daily AQI data from the EPA to visually display the improvement of the AQI in Allegheny County from the 1980’s until present day.

**Tree Pittsburgh**

I will be using resources provided by Tree Pittsburgh to highlight: 
1. The tangible benefits of urban forests
1. Resources available to readers who want to take action by volunteering, donating, learning, and more

* https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/benefits-of-trees/
* https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/pittsburgh-urban-forest-master-plan/ 

*Note: I may tentatively incorporate a timeline of urban forestry practices in Pittsburgh, and if so, it would be scraped from this historical background file: https://www.treepittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pittsburgh_urban_forest_master_plan_201208_-_05-08_historical_background.pdf*

**Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center: City of Pittsburgh Trees**

I may use raw data from this very large dataset (45,703 trees and counting!) to supplement information regarding the current state of the Pittsburgh urban forest and the benefits that urban trees provide:  https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees


## Initial Wireframe / Storyboard

I created my wireframe and flow of story in the following PDF:

## User Research and Interviews
### What I Hope to Find
Taking note from our recent in-class discussion on how to create the user story, my hope for readers (including these test users), is that they will feel moved to learn more and/or contribute to improving the Pittsburgh urban forest, so that they can enjoy better air quality, among other benefits. I will hope to hear feedback from my test users that they felt, or did not feel, a combination of 1) shocked/alarmed by the historical and current data and 2) moved to learn more about how to help improve the situation. 

### Target Audience
I have selected the following Pittsburgh-based test users, with an aim to include a diverse set professions and educational backgrounds
* Male, 40's, Teacher
* Male, 40's, Sales
* Male, 60's, Retired
* *Note: Unfortunately, I was not able to gather feedback from two female volunteers (20's and 30's) as originally planned.* 

### Research Questions & Script
Being mindful of not leading my test users on with too much context or information, I did provide them some background to the purpose of this class and this project, and some additional notes on how the final product would be presented:

*This final project is designed to help us learn how to use data to tell a more compelling story and ideally motivate a reader/listener to take action.* 

*It will be hosted on [Shorthand.com](https://www.piie.com/microsites/globalization/what-is-globalization), so look at these seven pages/panels with the idea that in their final form, they’ll exist on a more interactive and continuous scrolling website, with richer background images, fonts etc.*

*Please keep in mind that on our presentation day, we have just 60 seconds to walk the audience through our “story”, and so the ability to take deeper dives on any one part of the data is limited.* 


### Interview Results
The full set of responses are below, but major themes and significant points included:
* :heavy_check_mark: The data sufficiently conveyed that while Pittsburgh has made progress on air quality, more work is needed
* :heavy_check_mark: Users felt motivated to support Tree Pittsburgh based on the data, especially volunteering and/or donating
* :warning:Re-evaluating the presentation of the bar chart, as a way to compare cities across the U.S. Users felt it was hard to understand and/or digest the full spread of data. 
* :warning: Making it clear that trees are not solely responsible for the improvement trends in area air quality, to avoid misleading users
* :warning: Ensuring that the placeholder page for "How Do Trees Make A Difference" contains compelling information to support the proposed solutions 
* :warning: Articulate that even though improvements have been made in Pittsburgh, and there are non-profits already working on the issues, the casue needs every person to step up to succeed. *This idea stemmed from one user's comment that while they feel the data is indeed compelling, it also looks like a lot of people are already working on it, so they don't need his help at this point.*

### Resulting Changes to Draft Materials 
Major changes I'll be making as a result of the feedback I received include:
* Re-evaluating the presentation of the bar chart as a way to compare cities across the U.S. I will explore additional ways to convey the severity of Pittsburgh's low rankings as compared to the 200+ cities in the data set, that doesn't overwhelm the viewer/reader with bars.
* While the line graph shown was a placeholder, when I visualize the same data, I will draw more attention the threshold/passing limit line, to clarify the significance of Pittsburgh's failure to fall within the acceptable pollution range. 
* Re-visualizing the bubble chart tree at the end, to reflect more as a "growing" image or chart, instead of static illustration.
