# Breathing Easier in the Pittsburgh Urban Forest - Final Project Part 2

## Revisting and Revising Key Ideas from [Part 1 of the Final Project](/FinalProject.md)

### Introduction & Refocusing Project Action Items
My original final project was aimed to inspire readers to support the efforts specifically of [Tree Pittsburgh](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/); however, after some post-class discussion after week 5, I decided to avoid any potential affiliation issues by broadening the action item scope to several Pittsburgh-based environmental groups. The core story remains the same however: Motivate readers/viewers to explore ways to help grow the urban forest, but showing them historical and current measurements of the air quality/pollution of the Pittsburgh region, and let them know how urban trees can improve our air. 

### User Stories / Personas
The user stories remained consistent from Part 1, but I revised the personas further as:
* Residents of the Pittsburgh Region
* 25-55 years old
* Likely old enough to either remember more polluted days or remember conversations their families have had about more polluted days
* Likely young enough to feel hopeful and motivated to take action for change

The goal is to motivate them to support area non-profits (not just Tree Pittsburgh); **So they can:**
* Enjoy better air quality in their community
* Improve community relations
*	Increase area property values

**They can do this by:**
*	Volunteering to plant and care for city trees
*	Contributing financially 
*	Learning more / educating myself
*	Organizing volunteer opportunities within my community


### Test User Feedback (Part 1) and Resulting Changes (Part 2) 

Taking questions 4 thru 6 from the original user feedback grid from Part 1, I've reflected on the changes I've made as a result. The largest change by far was to scrap the original bar chart in lieu of a point map. It reduces the number of data points for a user to review from 50 to 25, and also unexpectedly draws attention to the fact that Pittsburgh is the most polluted city east of Arizona; a startling fact that doesn't jump out until it's displayed on a map. I was able to use accompanying text in the final project page to highlight the numerical elements of the ranking data instead. Additional changes and reflections appear in the chart below:

## Final Project on Shorthand
From Part 1 to Part 2, I opted not to create revised wireframes, but to instead practice my refinements and changes within Shorthand, to allow for extra practice in creating and adjusting my elements within that space. While at first I resented the inflexibility of some elements of layouts and design, I came to appreciate the limitations, as it allowed me to focus more on my message and the data I was trying to feature.  I've linked to my Shorthand page here:
