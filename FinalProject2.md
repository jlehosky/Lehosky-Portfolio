# Breathing Easier in the Pittsburgh Urban Forest - Final Project Part 2

## Recapping Key Ideas from [Part 1 of the Final Project](/FinalProject.md)

### Introduction & Outline
For my final project, I want to inspire readers to support the efforts of the [Tree Pittsburgh](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/); *“an environmental non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing community vitality by restoring and protecting the urban forest through tree planting and care, education, advocacy, and land conservation”* (Tree Pittsburgh, 2020). While there is a myriad of benefits to increasing a city’s urban forest canopy, the primary data I’ll be using to compel readers/viewers to action is historical and current measurements of the air quality/pollution of the Pittsburgh region.  

As suggested in Chapter 8 of Good Charts (Berinato, 2016), I’ve divided my narrative into three sections, and the desired emotional response to each section is one of Urgency (:red_circle:), Concern (:warning:), Optimism (:heavy_check_mark:), or Neutral Knowledge (:bulb:):

**Setup: The current reality**

:red_circle: Opening with a dramatic visual to capture the reader’s attention and paint a dire picture (diametrically opposed images separated by slider)

:warning: Sharing a current view of pollution levels in the Pittsburgh area, as compared to the least/most polluted cities in the U.S. (1-3 bar charts)

:bulb: How do urban trees improve air quality and community engagement?

**Conflict: Information to make the reader aware just how far Pittsburgh still has to go**

:warning: Tile plots comparing Allegheny County Air Quality Index (AQI) scores over a 40-year span (by either 10 or 20 year increments) 

:red_circle: Line graphs of air quality measurements over 20-year period; the catch is that while these charts reflect a great improvement, the present day levels STILL exceed acceptable levels, earning Allegheny County a continuing "F" grade across all three air pollution measures (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)
  
**Resolution: The new/potential reality**

:heavy_check_mark: There’s hope! Here’s information on Pittsburgh success stories 

:heavy_check_mark: How YOU can you help your community thrive and breathe easier by partnering with Tree Pittsburgh



### User Stories / Narrative
Putting myself into the shoes of those reading and viewing this information, I've used the "user stories" tool we practiced in class to hone in on what will motivate viewers to take interest in this issue, and the calls to action available to the reader/user:

**As a reader I want to** help support Tree Pittsburgh’s goal of planting more trees 

**So that I can:**
* Enjoy better air quality in my community
* Improve community relations
*	Increase area property values

**I can do this by:**
*	Volunteering to plant and care for city trees
*	Contributing financially 
*	Learning more / educating myself
*	Organizing volunteer opportunities within my community

To the tell this story, I plan to use Storyboard, and will be supplementing this with charts from Flourish and Tableau, and images from Unplash and Pexels.

## Data Sources

**The American Lung Association’s 2020 [State of the Air](http://www.stateoftheair.org/) Report**

I will be using data from this report to illustrate both:
1. How Pittsburgh ranks on various measures compared to the best/worst cities in the U.S.  
1. A 20-year historical snapshot of the linear progress made in the Pittsburgh area as it relates to the three measures of air pollution (Ozone, Short-term Particle, and Yearly Particle)

**United States Environmental Protection Agency – Outdoor Air Quality Data Website**

I will be using daily AQI data from the EPA to visually display the improvement of the AQI in Allegheny County from the 1980’s until present day.

**Tree Pittsburgh**

I will be using resources provided by Tree Pittsburgh to highlight: 
1. The tangible benefits of urban forests
1. Resources available to readers who want to take action by volunteering, donating, learning, and more

* [https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/benefits-of-trees/](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/benefits-of-trees/)
* [https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/pittsburgh-urban-forest-master-plan/](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/resource/pittsburgh-urban-forest-master-plan/)

*Note: I may tentatively incorporate a timeline of urban forestry practices in Pittsburgh, and if so, it would be scraped from this historical background file: [https://www.treepittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pittsburgh_urban_forest_master_plan_201208_-_05-08_historical_background.pdf](https://www.treepittsburgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pittsburgh_urban_forest_master_plan_201208_-_05-08_historical_background.pdf)*

**Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center: City of Pittsburgh Trees**

I may use raw data from this very large dataset (45,703 trees and counting!) to supplement information regarding the current state of the Pittsburgh urban forest and the benefits that urban trees provide: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees)
