## Review of Visualizations
Beginning with the original bar chart above, this method provided a clear hiearchy of low-to-high values, but required frequent scanning from country name to the ratio amount and back again.  The second chart presents the country and its relative values in closer proximity, and but unlike the bar chart, comparing two countries side-by-side is now more challenge.  This chart does have the benefit of showing trends over time however, and using using the grid of line charts allow a reader to easily scan over the countries to notice patterns that stand out. 

For the third chart, I wanted to select a visualization that would add an layer of recognizable comparison, and so selected a familiar map of Europe to use as the foundation. With a desire to make take advantage of "we see first what stands out" (Berinato, 2016), I selected a color palette with pale muted oranges on the low ratio side, and more alarming, vibrant reds on the high ratio side.
